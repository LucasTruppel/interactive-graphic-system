# Todo: add 3d curve button to main screen
# add 3d curve window when button is pressed.
# this window should show current curves 
# and allow user to add new curves.
# new curves should be added in an extra window, 
# since it's a 4x4 matrix, with a total of 16 points, 
# meaning each point has 3 fields of input (x,y,z).
